### Background

The financial departments of large companies often deal with foreign currency transactions while doing international business.

Hedge funds, too, are keenly interested in anything that will give them a consistent edge in predicting currency movements. <br/>
In this assignment, you will test the many time-series tools that you have learned in order to predict future movements in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.
